Log into your WordPress site using a smartphone... No typing and no passwords! (almost)

== Description ==

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-YuU7NAMZM&rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0]

With this plugin you can make passwords a thing of the past. All you need is your trusty smartphone with a QR Code reading app.

(Coming soon, iOS companion app that will negate your need for a separate QR Code reading app!)

Disclaimer: A website is only as secure as the least secure component on it. This plugin aims to be more secure than using the default login page.

== Installation ==

1. Upload plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it

= Usage =

1. Scan QR code on login screen of your site. (Coming soon, iOS companion app!)
2. Open link scanned in your mobile browser.
3. That's it! (If you don't have a cookie on your mobile browser recognizing you, the first time you try this you'll have to log in on your phone. After that you should be home free)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I need to log in on my phone? =

You wouldn't want just ANYONE being able to access your site. Verification is still necessary.

= So what's this plugin good for? =

Once you log in once, you won't have to again until your phone cookie runs out (every two weeks or so). That should save you SOME hassle.

= What about foo bar? =

I have no answer to foo bar dilemma.
